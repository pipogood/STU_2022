# High Precision 1-DOF Robot

In this project, our team is tasked with designing a 1 DOF robotic mechanism and controlling the rotation of a DC motor.

For my part, I am designing a DC motor control system that receives the motor's position from an encoder and implements closed-loop control to achieve a target angular position.

This project is implemented on the STM32-F411RE using STM32Cube IDE, with the main code located in UART_Basesystem/Core/Src/main.c.
